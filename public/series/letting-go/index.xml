      <description>Bad Food I am letting go of bad food.
Bad food to me is
 Unhealthy Harmful to my teeth Meat (I will expand) Overly expensive Ornamental Idolized  Unhealthy I do not really know what is unhealthy.. I think many things in moderation are probably okay.. That said I know that I want to avoid excess
 Salt Sugar Saturated Fat Calories  So what do I actually eat now that I find unhealthy.</description>

      <description>Video Games I am letting go of video games.
Binge I binge two games annually.. Crusader Kings (whatver iteration is latest) and Europa Universalis 4. I find maybe twice a year where I play one or the other until I burn out.. Typically about 30 hours..
This year I have also played about half of fallout 3 and equally as much of fallout 4.
Lonliness Playing games makes me feel horribly lonely.</description>
