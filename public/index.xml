      <description>Instagram I cannot help myself from abuse instagram. I tried&amp;hellip; I want to connect with friends&amp;hellip; but it is too addicting
Scrolling It is near impossible not to scroll. I try to catch up with my friends. I scroll. I feel sad.
Connection I want to connect.. Instagram can facillitate that.. However, these are often shallow connections. That might be okay, but if I want more than a quick rush&amp;hellip; I need to make the effort to connect in person.</description>

      <description>Cost of Living Projections Introduction I do not like negotiating for salary. Especially, without valid projections to determine a range.
I prepared this report to estimate a salary expectation that will maintain my current standard of living.
I present two Monte Carlo models of Houston and NYC annual living costs. The data is somewhat dated and &amp;ndash;particularly in the case of houston&amp;ndash; are high level estimates.
In order to produce a better report, I am currently scraping data from the internet for more accurate sample distributions.</description>

      <description>Spearman Rank in Standard Julia Well nearly, I did import the erfc function from the SpecialFunctions package. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it either. I&amp;rsquo;ll write my own soon to make up for it.
Special Thanks I came across the text Numerical Recipes in C. It was first published in 1988, by the Cambridge University Press. The authors are William H. Press, Brian P. Flannery, Saul. A. Teukolsky, and William T. Veterling.</description>

      <description>Churn Modelling Marketing Data with Julia Introduction I prepared this analysis to learn the logistic regression in Julia. The work is fairly straightforward. I am modelling if a customer will exit a website based on a number of sites. I&amp;rsquo;ll improve the model in an upcoming post. As if, is not as interesting as asking when. That will be my next project

      <description>Introduction I am currently working on a legal research series where I perform statistical analysis and ml models to legal datasets. My intention is to model the behavior of courts, determine the outcome of cases, and build a pipeline capable of identifying relevant case law by issue area.
That data set is nearly complete, but I have not decided which models to apply to it. This is where Julia comes into play.</description>

In this post, I include a few sample programs to test your installation.
How to run the programs I saved them to a folder within the project directory.

      <description>Introduction The legal Research with AI Series is expanding quickly. This is the 9th post related to it in someway. Building this pipeline and integrating multiple datasets into nodes is proving to be verbose.
This post documents merging Oyez and Library of Congress of data structured json files that represent nodes and hierarchal relationships.
Main Function The plan for this program is to:
 Read the prepared dataframe created in the legal research part 7 post for each row of the df load a dictionary from the the libary of congress path and the oyez path Set keys on the Oyez dataset Write the updated Oyez dataset to file  Review the work below:</description>

The Runner Program The raw structure of the data is organized by the results of the api requests. There are thus 80 cases per file.</description>

      <description>Integrating the Constitution to Neo4j I am currenlty building a graph database of Supreme Court cases in neo4j to model the behavior and decison making of the court.
In this post, I include the classes that I will be using to create individual nodes for the articles, sections, clauses, and subclauses of the Consititution.
Later, these will be related to cases and subjecst in order to train a tensorflow algorithm to recommend case law by issue area and to predict the outcome of cases.</description>

      <description>Introduction In a previous post, I detailed the process of crawling the Library of Congress API to generate json files that could be intergrated into you DB of choice.
In this discussion, we will integrate JSON data into a Neo4j graph database.
Overview The process is fairly straightforward. The most difficult part is wrangling your json data into the right format for integration.
The main function first instantiates the database config informormation.</description>

      <description>Crawling the Library of Congress API Introduction The United States Library of Congress maintains a rest api for developers to crawl their collections. It is an open source tool that anyone can access in order to conduct research. Check out the documenation at https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/.
Creating a crawler I took the approach of writing a generator that produces a search result page object that can be operated upon with each iteration.</description>

      <description>Feasibility of Shipping Carbon Across the Atlantic Methodology Please review the my previous post which details the design of my model.
The major difference in this report is the sampling of the mean price per voyage.
The conversion error has been corrected.
Findings Distance of Transport The standard deviation in mean price per voyage was found to be less than 0. This suggests that the distance of travel within Europe is marginal.</description>

      <description>A Monte Carlo Projection of the Annual Cost of Shipping Carbon from Europe to US Ports Revision An earlier version of this report had reported values that were erroneously elevated by a decimal error in the meters to km conversion of distances between ports. I apologize for unintentionally publishing misleading information.
Situations like this one, are why I always publish with code. Transparency is the key to rigor.
Introduction I produced an earlier report that identified potential ports that may be suitable terminals for carbon imports into the United States for storage or industrial applications.</description>

      <description>The World Trade Organization, Governments, and International Trade Intro International Organizations are vital to the operation of International politics. They regulate behaviors, facilitate communication, and promote cooperation between states. The process by which International Organizations come into being is well discussed in the literature, however, not equally well debated is the process by which International Organizations come to modify their operating procedure. Or in other words, when the member states renegotiate the terms of their membership.</description>
