      <description>Model Design and Logistic Regression in Python I recently modeled customer churn in Julia with logistic regression model. It was interesting to be sure, but I want to extend my analysis skillset by modeling biostatistics data. In this post, I design a logistic regression model of health predictors.&#xA;Imports # load some default Python modules import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns plt.</description>

      <description>Cost of Living Projections Introduction I do not like negotiating for salary. Especially, without valid projections to determine a range.&#xA;I prepared this report to estimate a salary expectation that will maintain my current standard of living.&#xA;I present two Monte Carlo models of Houston and NYC annual living costs. The data is somewhat dated and &amp;ndash;particularly in the case of houston&amp;ndash; are high level estimates.&#xA;In order to produce a better report, I am currently scraping data from the internet for more accurate sample distributions.</description>

      <description>Spearman Rank in Standard Julia Well nearly, I did import the erfc function from the SpecialFunctions package. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it either. I&amp;rsquo;ll write my own soon to make up for it.&#xA;Special Thanks I came across the text Numerical Recipes in C. It was first published in 1988, by the Cambridge University Press. The authors are William H. Press, Brian P. Flannery, Saul. A. Teukolsky, and William T. Veterling.</description>

      <description>Churn Modelling Marketing Data with Julia Introduction I prepared this analysis to learn the logistic regression in Julia. The work is fairly straightforward. I am modelling if a customer will exit a website based on a number of sites. I&amp;rsquo;ll improve the model in an upcoming post. As if, is not as interesting as asking when. That will be my next project&#xA;Imports using Pkg using DataFrames using CSV using Plots using GLM using StatsBase using Lathe using MLBase using ClassImbalance using ROCAnalysis using PyCall sklearn = pyimport(&amp;#34;sklearn.</description>

      <description>Introduction I am currently working on a legal research series where I perform statistical analysis and ml models to legal datasets. My intention is to model the behavior of courts, determine the outcome of cases, and build a pipeline capable of identifying relevant case law by issue area.&#xA;That data set is nearly complete, but I have not decided which models to apply to it. This is where Julia comes into play.</description>

      <description>Introduction Currently, my server is mining data from the neo4j graph database.&#xA;This post contains a control model completed in SPSS that will serve as the base line for comparison to Ml models. It includes a short literature review of the theoritical foundation of the Attitudinal Model of Judicial Behavior.&#xA;Hypothesis When considering the individual Supreme Court Justices, their voting behavior may be best described by the interaction between their ideological precepts and the facts of the case.</description>
