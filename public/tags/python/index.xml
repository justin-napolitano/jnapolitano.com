      <description>Background In the previous few posts I detailed my progress in automating a site. I am going about this by using an rss scraper to post new posts to social.
I had initally thought about doing this really naively, but I want a database. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right without using one. I am somewhat upset with myself, because I am basically just recreating wordpress&amp;hellip; but so it goes.
Previous posts in this series  part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 part 5  Expand a previous script In a previous post I wrote about how to scan an rss feed on my personal site.</description>

      <description>Overview This script is designed to initialize and update all submodules in a GitHub repository to the latest commits from their respective remote repositories. It ensures that all submodules, including nested submodules, are synchronized with their remote counterparts.
Prerequisites  Ensure that you have Git installed on your system. Ensure that you have cloned the repository containing the submodules.  Usage  Save the script to a file, for example, sync_submodules.</description>

      <description>Why I have a hugo blog that is a pian to share across my social feeds. I want to automate it.
Create a mockup For this I quickly sketched out my thoughts onto a writing pad. My thinking is that I will drop a yaml file into each post directory to be read by a a python application calling social apis.
Mockup As you can see this is very rudimentary. I will traverse the posts directories looking for a publish.</description>

      <description>Cost of Living Projections Introduction I do not like negotiating for salary. Especially, without valid projections to determine a range.
I prepared this report to estimate a salary expectation that will maintain my current standard of living.
I present two Monte Carlo models of Houston and NYC annual living costs. The data is somewhat dated and &amp;ndash;particularly in the case of houston&amp;ndash; are high level estimates.
In order to produce a better report, I am currently scraping data from the internet for more accurate sample distributions.</description>

This post documents merging Oyez and Library of Congress of data structured json files that represent nodes and hierarchal relationships.
Main Function The plan for this program is to:
 Read the prepared dataframe created in the legal research part 7 post for each row of the df load a dictionary from the the libary of congress path and the oyez path Set keys on the Oyez dataset Write the updated Oyez dataset to file  Review the work below:</description>

      <description>Introduction Currently, my server is mining data from the neo4j graph database.
This post contains a control model completed in SPSS that will serve as the base line for comparison to Ml models. It includes a short literature review of the theoritical foundation of the Attitudinal Model of Judicial Behavior.
Hypothesis When considering the individual Supreme Court Justices, their voting behavior may be best described by the interaction between their ideological precepts and the facts of the case.</description>

In this post, I will arrange the data into a data structure that will permit me to easily create graph nodes and most importantly relationships.
The Runner Program The raw structure of the data is organized by the results of the api requests. There are thus 80 cases per file.</description>

      <description>Integrating the Constitution to Neo4j I am currenlty building a graph database of Supreme Court cases in neo4j to model the behavior and decison making of the court.
In this post, I include the classes that I will be using to create individual nodes for the articles, sections, clauses, and subclauses of the Consititution.
Later, these will be related to cases and subjecst in order to train a tensorflow algorithm to recommend case law by issue area and to predict the outcome of cases.</description>

      <description>Introduction In a previous post, I detailed the process of crawling the Library of Congress API to generate json files that could be intergrated into you DB of choice.
In this discussion, we will integrate JSON data into a Neo4j graph database.
Overview The process is fairly straightforward. The most difficult part is wrangling your json data into the right format for integration.
The main function first instantiates the database config informormation.</description>

      <description>Crawling the Library of Congress API Introduction The United States Library of Congress maintains a rest api for developers to crawl their collections. It is an open source tool that anyone can access in order to conduct research. Check out the documenation at https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/.
Creating a crawler I took the approach of writing a generator that produces a search result page object that can be operated upon with each iteration.</description>

      <description>Feasibility of Shipping Carbon Across the Atlantic Methodology Please review the my previous post which details the design of my model.
The major difference in this report is the sampling of the mean price per voyage.
The conversion error has been corrected.
Findings Distance of Transport The standard deviation in mean price per voyage was found to be less than 0. This suggests that the distance of travel within Europe is marginal.</description>

      <description>A Monte Carlo Projection of the Annual Cost of Shipping Carbon from Europe to US Ports Revision An earlier version of this report had reported values that were erroneously elevated by a decimal error in the meters to km conversion of distances between ports. I apologize for unintentionally publishing misleading information.
Situations like this one, are why I always publish with code. Transparency is the key to rigor.
Introduction I produced an earlier report that identified potential ports that may be suitable terminals for carbon imports into the United States for storage or industrial applications.</description>
