      <description>Baja Seat Covers So my car is ready for some new seat covers. I am not going to spend the money to replace the original ones. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. So I am going to cover them with blankets and hope for the best.
The plan I am going to drape them over the front seats and cut some holes for the head rest to pass through. Then I will sew the seat covers together (probably) to keep them from moving around.</description>

While driving what do I really want?
 I do not want impact anyting I do not want to hit others I do not want a ticket I want to minimize damage to my car I want to drive efficiently  How do I accomplish these things This is harder.</description>

      <description>Win-Sets I read a paper in university about the way institutions make decisions&amp;hellip; Or should I say the people wihtin an institution make decisions. I have applied it to analysis, but not my actual life. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try that now.
Background A decision is made when all parties responsible for making a decision permit a decision to be made. The author I think posed this as when it is in the perceived interest of the legitimate decision maker.</description>

      <title>Everything Matters</title>

      <description>Why am I writing this I think that everything&amp;hellip; literally every detail is important.
Everything Matters I do not know if this a radical idea. From my experience, I recall people saying to me&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;it is fine&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;it is good enough&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;that doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; I disagree. To me, every individual detail matters. The context of a situation or the state of an environment at any given state in time influences my mind.</description>

      <description>Smoking Cigarettes&amp;hellip; Again Yesterday I wrote about smoking cigarettes and going out. I had told myself I was over it&amp;hellip;.
A Date Before I Leave Town I had coffee with someone that I am interested before taking off on a road trip to Colorado. At the root of it I think I am attracted to her. I can come up with a number of reasons why.. but I do not really know.</description>

      <title>Eating Raising Canes</title>

      <description>Why am I writing this Tonight, I mistreated my body. I had raising Canes. I feel disgusting.
Food review I tried the combo box - a massive amount of french fries served with coleslaw, some bread, and some chicken tenders.
The Fries They were fries - the crinkle cut variety- fried up in old grease. They tasted like typical fries, but the oil was so old that the fries tasted like the grease underneath the lunch room tables you&amp;rsquo;d find a public high school.</description>

      <description>Why Life is hard enough. Do not chase glory.
What do I mean Life is hard enough. Every single act within my daily life is incredibly difficult. I am nearly 30 years old and still have to force myself to brush my teath every day, to shower, to eat a few square meals a day. These little daily tasks that are truly important to our health and wellbeing are by far the most difficult and sometimes the least prioritized.</description>

      <description>Smoking Cigarettes I used to smoke when I went out with friends. That was years ago. I left that behind me as one of those things I did in college.
Tonight I went out with someone I met recently at a cafe. A friend of a friend. We had an okay time, but I did not feel the chemistry I had hoped for. We went to a restaurant that was okay.</description>

      <guid>jnapolitano.com/posts/enter_my_car/</guid>
      <description>Why am I writing this I am trying to approach life from the perspective that every action throughout the day&amp;hellip; no matter how mundane&amp;hellip; defines in some way my character. Each little action can either make life easier or more difficult for me. I do not know if it is possible for an action to be completely neutral.. I am thinking that through.
Entering my car How do I currently enter my car?</description>

      <description>Why i like to exercise. i like to over-exercise. i do not listen to my body when it needs rest. i feel as if more movement is more better.
i am getting older. i do not recover quickly.
Running when i feel stressed i run. it is a low cost way to move.
Running too far when i run, i feel a need to prove to myself that i am a runner.</description>

      <guid>jnapolitano.com/posts/curate-an-edc-pouch/</guid>
      <description>Why i have a bunch of random tools and pouches laying about. I don&amp;rsquo;t like it. So to feel better i want to organize a pouch that i can throw into any of my bags so that i can deal with most things i face in day to day to life.
Guiding principles  I want tools that reduce the friction in my average day to day dealings I want the pouch to be small enough to fit inside all of my bags I want the tool set to be modular so that it can be used as the base of other kits.</description>
