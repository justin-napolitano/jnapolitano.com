      <description>Methane Emissions Estimation Data Part 2: A Comparison between FAOSTAT and University of Malaysia Estimates This post documents the data exploration phase of a project that determines whether global methane emissions produced by rice paddies are undercounted.
It is fairly code python and pandas heavy.
The code and data exploration follows the summary below.
Hypothesis Testing the University of Malaysia Paper Claims  That the distributions do not differ between 2020 and 2019 That the means do no differ between 2020 and 2019  What will be Tested.</description>
