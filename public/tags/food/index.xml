      <description>Why am I writing this Tonight, I mistreated my body. I had raising Canes. I feel disgusting.
Food review I tried the combo box - a massive amount of french fries served with coleslaw, some bread, and some chicken tenders.
The Fries They were fries - the crinkle cut variety- fried up in old grease. They tasted like typical fries, but the oil was so old that the fries tasted like the grease underneath the lunch room tables you&amp;rsquo;d find a public high school.</description>
