      <description>Background In the previous few posts I detailed my progress in automating a site. I am going about this by using an rss scraper to post new posts to social.
I had initally thought about doing this really naively, but I want a database. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right without using one. I am somewhat upset with myself, because I am basically just recreating wordpress&amp;hellip; but so it goes.

      <description>Thoughts on This Second Pass  I will create a script that parses the sites rss feed&amp;hellip; it will then traverse the xml tree entries&amp;hellip; if a date is newer than the last publish date&amp;hellip; publish that post&amp;hellip;  I am still thinking through how to publish. I will likely write a monolithic script here, but ideally I would write an api or a batch processor to handle this in some way.</description>

      <description>Why I have a hugo blog that is a pian to share across my social feeds. I want to automate it.
Create a mockup For this I quickly sketched out my thoughts onto a writing pad. My thinking is that I will drop a yaml file into each post directory to be read by a a python application calling social apis.
Mockup As you can see this is very rudimentary. I will traverse the posts directories looking for a publish.</description>
