      <description>Baja Seat Covers So my car is ready for some new seat covers. I am not going to spend the money to replace the original ones. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. So I am going to cover them with blankets and hope for the best.
The plan I am going to drape them over the front seats and cut some holes for the head rest to pass through. Then I will sew the seat covers together (probably) to keep them from moving around.</description>
