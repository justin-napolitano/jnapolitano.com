      <description>Running I like to run&amp;hellip; or maybe I like to jog. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter. I like move a little faster than walking.
My Goals When I run I just move. I don&amp;rsquo;t really think about what my goals are. I guess I try to be fast. I think this is wrong. What would I rather focus on?
 Breathing Avoiding injury Remaining balanced Adapting to the terrain  Breathing I hold my breath when I run.</description>

      <description>Gray&amp;rsquo;s Gray&amp;rsquo;s is a rather easy 14&amp;rsquo;er about an hour west of Denver.
 14er Link  Details  Coordinates: 39.66087, -105.78462 Elevation: 11,280&#39; Trailhead Access: High Clearence Vehicle Camping: Yeah Restrooms: Yeah  The Approach I borrowed an SUV. It was a doable drive. I kept her in first gear and took it slow. There were a few sketchy parts along the way.. but it really wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad.. at least in the right vehicle.</description>
