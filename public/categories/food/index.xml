      <description>Why am I writing this Tonight, I mistreated my body. I had raising Canes. I feel disgusting.
Food review I tried the combo box - a massive amount of french fries served with coleslaw, some bread, and some chicken tenders.
The Fries They were fries - the crinkle cut variety- fried up in old grease. They tasted like typical fries, but the oil was so old that the fries tasted like the grease underneath the lunch room tables you&amp;rsquo;d find a public high school.</description>

      <description>Why I am hungry. I have a bunch of ingredients. I have a left over rotisserie chicken. I do not want to waste.
Audit your supplies In my case I have at my disposal
 About half a rotisserie chicken. Greek yogurt. Coriander. Grape tomatotes. Honey. Dates.  Prepare your food Cut up the chicken breast Just remove chicken breast. Then cut it up into small chunks.
Cut up the herbs I am using left-over coriander leaves to add some vitamins and flavor to my dinner.</description>
