      <description>Win-Sets I read a paper in university about the way institutions make decisions&amp;hellip; Or should I say the people wihtin an institution make decisions. I have applied it to analysis, but not my actual life. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try that now.
Background A decision is made when all parties responsible for making a decision permit a decision to be made. The author I think posed this as when it is in the perceived interest of the legitimate decision maker.</description>

      <description>Background In the previous few posts I detailed my progress in automating a site. I am going about this by using an rss scraper to post new posts to social.
I had initally thought about doing this really naively, but I want a database. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right without using one. I am somewhat upset with myself, because I am basically just recreating wordpress&amp;hellip; but so it goes.

      <description>Using GitHub Template Repositories to Automate Script Deployment Managing multiple repositories can be a challenge, especially when you need to ensure that each one includes certain common scripts or configurations. GitHub&amp;rsquo;s template repositories feature can help streamline this process. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through how to use a template repository to automatically include a gh_submodule_sync.sh script in every new repository you create.
Prerequisites  GitHub CLI: Ensure you have the GitHub CLI installed.</description>

      <description>Why I have a hugo blog that is a pian to share across my social feeds. I want to automate it.
Create a mockup For this I quickly sketched out my thoughts onto a writing pad. My thinking is that I will drop a yaml file into each post directory to be read by a a python application calling social apis.
Mockup As you can see this is very rudimentary. I will traverse the posts directories looking for a publish.</description>

      <description>Cost of Living Projections Introduction I do not like negotiating for salary. Especially, without valid projections to determine a range.
I prepared this report to estimate a salary expectation that will maintain my current standard of living.
I present two Monte Carlo models of Houston and NYC annual living costs. The data is somewhat dated and &amp;ndash;particularly in the case of houston&amp;ndash; are high level estimates.
In order to produce a better report, I am currently scraping data from the internet for more accurate sample distributions.</description>

That data set is nearly complete, but I have not decided which models to apply to it. This is where Julia comes into play.</description>

In this post, I include the classes that I will be using to create individual nodes for the articles, sections, clauses, and subclauses of the Consititution.
Later, these will be related to cases and subjecst in order to train a tensorflow algorithm to recommend case law by issue area and to predict the outcome of cases.</description>

In this discussion, we will integrate JSON data into a Neo4j graph database.
Overview The process is fairly straightforward. The most difficult part is wrangling your json data into the right format for integration.
The main function first instantiates the database config informormation.</description>

      <description>Crawling the Library of Congress API Introduction The United States Library of Congress maintains a rest api for developers to crawl their collections. It is an open source tool that anyone can access in order to conduct research. Check out the documenation at https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/.
Creating a crawler I took the approach of writing a generator that produces a search result page object that can be operated upon with each iteration.</description>

      <description>Feasibility of Shipping Carbon Across the Atlantic Methodology Please review the my previous post which details the design of my model.
The major difference in this report is the sampling of the mean price per voyage.
The conversion error has been corrected.
Findings Distance of Transport The standard deviation in mean price per voyage was found to be less than 0. This suggests that the distance of travel within Europe is marginal.</description>

Situations like this one, are why I always publish with code. Transparency is the key to rigor.
Introduction I produced an earlier report that identified potential ports that may be suitable terminals for carbon imports into the United States for storage or industrial applications.</description>
