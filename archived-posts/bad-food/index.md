# Bad Food

I am letting go of bad food.

Bad food to me is 

* Unhealthy
* Harmful to my teeth
* Meat (I will expand)
* Overly expensive
* Ornamental
* Idolized


## Unhealthy

I do not really know what is unhealthy.. I think many things in moderation are probably okay.. That said I know that I want to avoid excess

1. Salt
2. Sugar
3. Saturated Fat
4. Calories


So what do I actually eat now that I find unhealthy. 

### Fast Food 

I occasionally eat fast food.. Typically when I am on a road trip or when I do not plan well.. I am not going to do this... to the best of my ability again. 

### Ice Cream

There was a period when I was running 40ish miles a week. To keep up with my calorie demands I ate a lot of ice cream.  I quit eating ice cream because I felt gross.  I have more or less kept this up.. I will keep with it. 

## Harmful to My Teeth

I was not raised in an environment where it was easy to pick up healthy hygeine habits. I had to learn for myself how to care for my skin, teeth, body.. etc..  As I aside for a moment, this was not really my parent's fault.. It is generational back to my great grandparents (as far as I know).. It is just the reality of poor people from poor places.. from different times.. and of a different culture.  

Okay.. so back to the point... I have damaged my teeth moreso than I would have liked. I want to preserve what I have now.. As a teen  I ruined my teeth with soda. Into my early 20's I had worn down my molars badly because of soda consumption. 

I do not really drink soda anymore. I cannot think of when I had one last. Nonetheless I am going to try to avoid acidic and sugary sodas.. and foods to the best of my ability. I really do not want to pay for another root canal. 

### Meat

Meat is not necessarily bad. I am adding this because I feel badly for consuming animal products in general.. and even worse for consuming animals unecessarily.  I think that there is a place for consuming animal products.. and eating meat.. but I do not know if it is really necessary for me..  Getting enough nutrients without meat and fat is incredibly difficult. It requires more effort.. I have cut consumption by 90ish percent.. As in I have almost completely stopped eating meat.. but I do consume at on of milk.  

## Overly Expensive

I do not like feeling ripped off. I think much of the food on the market is overly priced to appeal to consumer trends. I do not want to eat food just because it is popular.. nor do I want to over pay for cheap food that fell off a sysco truck. 

## Ornamental

I do not know if ornamental is the correct word for me to use.  I am thinking that I do not want to eat food that has been overly prepared.  Salt Bae with his gold leaf is what I mean. I think an artful preparation of food is okay..But I do not like gimmicks.

## Idolized

I do not want to idolize a chef, my food, or anything really.
