# Instagram

I cannot help myself from abuse instagram. I tried... I want to connect with friends... but it is too addicting

## Scrolling

It is near impossible not to scroll. I try to catch up with my friends. I scroll. I feel sad. 

## Connection

I want to connect.. Instagram can facillitate that.. However, these are often shallow connections. That might be okay, but if I want more than a quick rush... I need to make the effort to connect in person. 


## Ads

Instagram pushes ads.. that are incredibly relevant to me. I want to purchase nearly all of them.  I did purchase $200.00 worth of fleece. I've wanted it for a while.. but I do not really need it. I think the ads... and everything is an ad is what brings me down the most.

## Substitution

I have tried to substitute the news for instagram. I do not think it is worthwhile. I have tried novels.. but I cannot just scroll through a novel in the same way I can with my insta... so in those idle times when I do not have the bandwidth to read a novel I need to find a good substitution.

## Chess or Go?

I think chess or go are good substitutes. I can play them pretty idly. I do not need to play well.. jus tplay for fun. I will improve over time.. probably.
