# Exercise

Staying active can be difficult. I recently moved from the center of Houston to Littleton Colorado.  I have driven more miles in the past 3 weeks than I have in 5 years.  I am not as fit as I used to be simply because I cannot bike nor walk to the park, cafe, etc...

## My Goals

So now I have to actually try to stay in shape. My daily goals are to...

1. Do some cardio
2. Do some calisthenics
3. Work on my balance

### Cardio

I am not going to set an explicit goal.. but I would like to walk/run about 3-5 miles every day. This feels right.. Unfortunately it takes a lot of effort because it I have to drive to the trails.. and make an event out of it rather than walking through the neighborhood. 

### Calisthenics

Calisthenics are somewhat easier to do. I have a pilates routine that I had done in the the past that I should work into my daily exercise routine. 

### Balance

I actually need to learn some balance exercises. I think the pilates and calisthenics are a good start.... but there must be more that I can do.
